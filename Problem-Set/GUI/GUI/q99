The task is to determine the maximum height and width of a window that can fit within the physical display area of the screen without srolling. This is effectively the screen size (not the total desktop area, which could be bigger than the screen display area) in pixels minus any adjustments for window decorations and menubars. The idea is to determine the physical display parameters for the maximum height and width of the usable display area in pixels (without scrolling). The values calculated should represent the usable desktop area of a window maximized to fit the the screen.
