Flibonakki series G(n) is defined as
G(n) = G(n-1) + f(4n-1) , for n > 0
and G(0) = 0
f(i) is our good old Fibonacci series. Given n you need to evaluate G(n).
Input

First line contains number of test cases t (t<40000). Each of the next t lines contain an integer n ( 0 < n < 2^51 ).
Output

For each test case print the nth flibonakki number modulo 1000000007.
Example

Input:
2
2
4


Output:
15
714
