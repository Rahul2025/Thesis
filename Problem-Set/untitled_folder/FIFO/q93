Implement a FIFO queue. Elements are added at one side and popped from the other in the order of insertion.
Operations:
push (aka enqueue) - add element
pop (aka dequeue) - pop first element
empty - return truth value when empty
Errors:
handle the error of trying to pop from an empty queue (behavior depends on the language and platform)
