\subsection{Benchmarking}
We know that our main aim was to speed-up Python. We want to use it's dynamic features, rich libraries, simplicity and along with that want to increase it's speed. So, In order to know the possible reasons why Python is slower than C started with benchmarking the following algorithms.
\subsection{Problems Used for Benchmarking}
\subsubsection{Josephous Problem}
\subsubsection{Longest Common Subsequence}
\subsubsection{Pollard's rho Algorithm}
\subsection{Computer Algebra System Software}
These are the results

\begin{itemize}
\item Python is interpreted, while C is compiled
\item Python has no primitives data types
\item List can handle more than one type of data,, so additional field is required
\item But development time in python is less than as compared to C
\end{itemize}
