Bench-marked various programming languages (C, C++, JAVA, Python, Cython, Haskell) and to complete a 3-dimensional matrix with the three dimensions as Fields(Graph Theory, Web Programming, Numerical Computability, NP-Hard etc.), Languages and Attributes(such as Compile time, Memory Usage, Security, Debugging etc.). Finally, we aim to develop a GUI tool to manifest the results.
