In this work we have suggested a modification to the simple inverted indexing of text documents by segmenting documents into \textit{context blocks} using anaphoric links in the text document, and a scoring algorithm to exploit term proximity information from this modified index. We have proposed a novel scoreboard based approach for this context-based-scoring of documents and suggest two different scoreboards for the same. Those suggestions were incorporated in a prototype system and tested in two distinct experimental setups; the results have been encouraging.

The work ,however, focusses on simply using the textual content of a document for the purposes of scoring strictly in text information retrieval sense. In future, we would like to study the effect of cotext based scoring in a general web search scenario. The context-based score obtained using proposed methods could be used to adjust the cross-linkage based scores like Page Rank. Also accuracy of the system can be improved by incorporating methods for relative pronoun resolution.
