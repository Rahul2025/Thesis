I would like to thank my thesis supervisor Dr. Amey karkare for his support and encouragement. He provided me freedom to experiment with new ideas and inculcated the techniques required to understand and progress my work. I am grateful for his patient guidance and advice in giving a proper direction to my efforts. 

I would like to thank many friends with whom I had many enjoyable as well as thought-provoking discussions. 

Last, but not the least, I would like to thank my parents who have been a constant source of support and encouragement. Their belief in me survived even as mine failed.
