Bench-marked various programming languages and to complete a 3-dimensional matrix with the three dimensions as Domains(Graph Theory, Web Programming, Numerical Computability, NP-Hard etc.), Languages(C, C++, JAVA, Python, Cython, Haskell) and Attributes(such as Compile time, Memory Usage, Runtime, Lines of Code etc.). Finally, we have developed a GUI tool to manifest the results.     
This GUI tool will show the previously calculated statistics and/or analysis as opted by the user. The statistical part will show all the calculated results in the form of tables, which can be viewed in any of the format(either language wise or field wise or sorted with respect to the attributes).
The other one is analysis part, in which we have displayed our analysis on the performance of various languages (in various fields) using the data that we calculated in the statistical part. We have also included characteristics of a different language(for user's help) in this tool.
